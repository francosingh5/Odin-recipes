            <li>Add the honey to the pot along with the hot water while stirring. TIP: Do not add the honey to more than 50º, otherwise it will lose its properties.</li>
            <li>Add the liquid to the container you are going to use for the fermentation, add the rest of the water until reaching a temperature between 25º and 45º and mix again.</li>
            <li>Separate a glass of the liquid and add the brewer's yeast or the fresh baker's yeast broken up with your fingers.</li>
            <li>Let the yeast act without stirring for 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Shake the mixture in the glass and let stand 5 more minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the liquid from the glass to the fermenter and close.</li>
