        <h4>Description:</h4>
        <p>The <strong>Nordic Meatball</strong> Also known as Swedish meatballs, they are made with minced beef mixed<br>
            with breadcrumbs soaked in milk and onions cut into small pieces.</p>
        <p>these meatballs are “mum's meatballs” a catchall expression in Sweden, and favorite recipes vary widely.<br>

            cut them into small pieces and fry them separately.
